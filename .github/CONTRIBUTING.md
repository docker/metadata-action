Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Write tests.
- Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant **documentation are kept up-to-date**.
- We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as **separate pull requests**.
